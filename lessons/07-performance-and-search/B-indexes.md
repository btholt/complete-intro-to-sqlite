Okay, so now we know we have a query we need to optimize. How do we do it? With an index!

An index makes a B-Tree (which stands for balanced tree) to make look ups much faster. Instead of taking O(n) to do a lookup items, it takes O(log n) since it can use a tree to find the item instead of scanning every item in the database.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_track_name ON Track (Name);

-- see it's there now
PRAGMA index_list('Track');

EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM Track Where name ='Black Dog';
-- `--SEARCH Track USING INDEX idx_track_name (Name=?)
```

Notice it's a SEARCH now instead of a SCAN. This means it was able to use an index and only look at a subset of the table instead of every row. Hooray!

```sql
EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM Track Where name ='Black Dog';
```

```

Again, I have a hard time reading this. You can see that it refers to the index in the comments so that's positive.

Okay so let's talk a little bit more about why you may not to index everything. I've heard the saying that indexes are like aspirin â€“ they're a great help when you have a problem but if you use too many they become a problem.

Every time you insert into a table that has indexes, it has to do some rebuilding of the indexes to accommodate this information. Likewise, if you delete, it has to move its nodes around its B-tree to keep it balanced. B-trees also take up space, and on large tables it can be non-trivial amounts of space. The trade-off here is that indexes help with reads but slow down updates, deletes, and inserts as well as take up space. In general I wait for a query to become a problem first before I try to index it, and even then I try to index only what I need to solve my problem. Pre-mature optimization generally is a bad thing to do because as developers we're pretty bad at guessing what's going to go wrong.
