It's because it's for version 3 of SQLite, the third major version.\n\n## Connecting to the database\n\nConnecting to a SQLite database from Node.js is a snap. Import the the sqlite3 library and create a `new` database.\n\n```javascript\nimport sqlite3 from \"sqlite3\";\n\nconst db = new sqlite3.Database(\"./my-database.db\");\n```\n\nAgain, keep in mind that SQLite databases are files. You need to give it a file path to be able to open the database and to start writing to it.\n\n## Querying the database\n\nOnce you have your `db` Database instance, you can then start running queries. There's a few functions to be aware of. We'll talk about the parameters to the functions after this.\n\n- `db.run(sql, params, callback)` – This will run a query and not care about the results. You generally use this to run `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands as you're just updating and not necessarily caring about what the database has to say back to you.\n- `db.get(sql, params, callback)` – Runs a query and only gives you back the first one. Some times all you need is one result (like when you're querying a unique ID). This simplifies your code a bit because you don't need an array of one result.\n- `db.all(sql, params, callback)` – Like get, but it gives you all results back that match the query instead of just one. It always returns an array. If you got no results, you get an empty array\n- `db.each(sql, params, callback, complete)` – Like all, but instead of one big array of results, your callback will get called once for each row in the set. Then the complete function will be called to let you know it's done. This is nice if you have some action you want to take on each row as it's basically a `.map()` of the result set instead of an array.\n\n## Node.js style callbacks (a.k.a. \"Nodebacks\")\n\nSome of you whippersnappers may be too young to remember writing JavaScript before promises, async-await, generators, etc. Before the magical time of ES2015 / ES6, we only had one way to deal with asynchronous code, callbacks. These are just functions that are invoked when something async completes.

They are Node.js callbacks as they always have the signature of `function myCallback(error, data)`. If that `error` is populated with anything, it means that something went wrong. Otherwise it succeeded. That's it. That's what makes a \"Nodeback\".\n\nSo with `.all()`, your code will look like this\n\n```javascript\ndb.rows(\n  `SELECT * FROM Track WHERE name LIKE '%live%'`,\n  [], // we'll talk about this array in a sec\n  function (err, rows) {\n    if (err) {\n      // do error stuff here\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // do stuff here with rows\n  }\n);\n```\n\n## Parameters and SQL Injection\n\nLet's take this example:\n\n```javascript\nconst id = getIdFromUser();\ndb.get(`SELECT * FROM Track WHERE TrackId=${id}`, [], function (err, row) {\n  // do stuff\n});\n```\n\nWhat's wrong with this? There's a **major** problem with this. If that id is coming from a user, it means they can put _anything_ there, right? So they could in theory put valid SQL in there.
