SQLite was written by Dr. D. Richard Hipp in 2000 while he was working on a contract for the United States Navy writing software for destroyers. He evaluated other database engines but ended up designing his own implementation.\n\nNow SQLite is [open source][timeline] ([GitHub mirror][gh]) and released to the public domain but it is not open to contributions. Dr. Hipp keeps tight control on the software and only lets a few people contribute. Notably, SQLite does not use Git but instead Fossil. [This is a nice little summary of how they differ][diff]. Fossil was created specifically by Dr. Hipp for the maintenance of SQLite (much like Git was for Linux.)\n\nIn practice you don't really need to care. The thing to take away is that Dr. Hipp and the SQLite crew take immense care of the project and are very thoughtful in maintaining an amazing project.\n\n## The Most Widely Deployed and Used Database Engine\n\n[SQLite is the most used database engine by a huge margin.][most-used]\n\nAccording to their website, SQLite is used in:\n\n- Every Android device\n- Every iPhone and iOS device\n- Every Mac\n- Every Windows10 machine\n- Every Firefox, Chrome, and Safari web browser\n- Every instance of Skype\n- Every instance of iTunes\n- Every Dropbox client\n- Every TurboTax and QuickBooks\n- PHP and Python\n- Most television sets and set-top cable boxes\n- Most automotive multimedia systems\n- Countless millions of other applications\n\nMany of these will continue actually hundreds of individual SQLite databases.

It runs everywhere and incredibly reliably so.\n\n## What is SQLite not?\n\nSQLite is not a server. It is not a standalone piece of software but instead, a library designed to be attached to a running program. Importantly for you, especially if you've used something like Postgres, MySQL, MongoDB, or any other piece of database software before, you won't have a database _server_ running. SQLite will just create a database file locally on your computer. Your SDK, CLI, or whatever method of accessing your database will just be pointed at that file and that's how you'll read and write to your database.\n\nImportantly **SQLite has no network access**.
